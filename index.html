          source, costs less than $20 to build, and assembles in seconds
          without any wiring or soldering.

        <p>
          Some ESP32 boards store colors differently in RAM, so the screen shows up with the wrong colors.
          If you have that issue, install this version instead.

        <h4>Help! Installation gets stuck at "Preparing to Install."</h4>
        <p>
        	It should not take very long to get past the "Preparing to Install" step. If it is stuck, it means that the board
        	is not connected to the computer correctly or the board is not going into update mode.
        </p>
        <p>
	        There are a variety of boards that have been produced and they may need slightly different approaches. Here
	        are the most common solutions:
        </p>
        <ol>
        	<li>In the list of ports, make sure you choose the one that says "USB Serial."
        	<li>Some boards need to be forced into flash mode by <b>holding down the <a target="_blank" href="https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display-CYD-Board-ESP32-2432S028R-back-labeled.jpg">RST button</a> while starting the installation.</b></li>
        	<li>Some boards need to be forced into flash mode by <b>pressing and holding <a target="_blank" href="https://i0.wp.com/randomnerdtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display-CYD-Board-ESP32-2432S028R-back-labeled.jpg">BOOT button</a>, pressing and releasing the RST button, then finally release thing BOOT button.</b></li>
        	<li>Some boards with two USB ports (USB-C and USB Micro) will only accept being flashed by one of the ports, so try both. While many USB-C boards will flash just fine via the USB-C connection, some only will update over the USB Micro connection.</li>
        </ol>
